#
# Question 1
# 1. This exercise is a cautionary tale about one of the most common, and 
# difficult to find, errors in Python. Write a definition for a class named 
# Kangaroo with the following methods:
#
#     1. An __init__ method that initializes an attribute named pouch_contents
#        to an empty list.
#     2. A method named put_in_pouch that takes an object of any type and adds
#        it to pouch_contents.
#     3. A __str__ method that returns a string representation of the Kangaroo 
#        object and the contents of the pouch.
#
# Test your code by creating two Kangaroo objects, assigning them to variables 
# named kanga and roo, and then adding roo to the contents of kanga's pouch.
