# Exercise 17.1
#
#
# 1. Download the code from this chapter from :
#    http://thinkpython2.com/code/Time2.py. 
# Change the attributes of Time to be a single integer representing seconds 
# since midnight. Then modify the methods (and the function int_to_time) to work
# with the new implementation. You should not have to modify the test code in 
# main. When you are done, the output should be the same as before.
